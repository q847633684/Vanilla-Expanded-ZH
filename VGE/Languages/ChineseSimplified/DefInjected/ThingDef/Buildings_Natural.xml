  <!-- EN: Something went terribly wrong. A huge and weird growth has spawned within the electrowomb, breaking it completely and spreading all around. This growth is a hatchery for small flies that can devour any living creature to the bone. It seems to be sensitive to daylight, but no one knows how far it can spread at night. -->
  <GR_FleshGrowth_Building.description>该死，我们的实验搞砸了！某种巨大畸形的血肉异殖体已撑破了孵化器，且正向四周快速扩散。这些恶心的东西同时也是繁殖血肉飞蝇的苗床，它们会逐渐吞噬掉所有能找到的生物。血肉异殖体似乎有些畏惧阳光，但在夜间却可以肆无忌惮地生长。</GR_FleshGrowth_Building.description>
