  <!-- EN: Dinobeetles are huge beasts that produce a nutrient rich, amber-like substance. They probably would use it to build complex structures similar to bees, but they don't because... well, because they are a scientific abomination doomed from the start... Because of its unique biological properties, it can nourish almost any creature and never rots. -->
