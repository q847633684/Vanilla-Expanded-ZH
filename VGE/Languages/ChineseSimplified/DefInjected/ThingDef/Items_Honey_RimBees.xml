  <!-- EN: This honey has been extracted from any genetic honeycomb, and has a very strange greenish tone that makes it less appetizing. Decays incredibly fast, but it can be consumed as a potent physically enhancing drug that doesn't cause any side effects. This honey can be consumed raw or cooked with other ingredients, and its properties transfer to the resulting meal. -->
  <RB_GeneticHoney.description>这种蜂蜜是从各种各样的基因蜂巢中提取出来的，腐烂速度要比其他种类的蜂蜜快得多。虽然绿绿的颜色让人完全提不起食欲，但却是一味能够强身健体的良药。蜂蜜可以生吃，也可以和其他食材一起煮来吃。</RB_GeneticHoney.description>
