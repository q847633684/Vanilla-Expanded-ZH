  <!-- EN: Calling back to an age of this planet’s history when mass-produced armoured units were needed to bolster a dwindling infantry force, the Roadkill is extremely simple, reliable and easy to assemble. They are very loud and vulnerable at the rear, while also being ridiculously thirsty and suited for short-range engagements. Are they accurate? No. Are they fast? Also no. A chore to repair? Yes, as the idea is not to maintain it but to assemble it on-site and leave it once it’s served its purpose. -->
  <VVE_Roadkill_Blueprint.description>T1载具。路霸坦克是个结构简单的战争机器。噪音巨大，后部装甲薄弱，而且耗油量离谱，只能用于近距离交战。打也打不准，开也开不快，修起来也让人骂娘，建议在前线就地组装一个，打完后就顺手把它丢了吧。\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;乘员：&lt;/color&gt;驾驶员 x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;动力：&lt;/color&gt;化合燃料</VVE_Roadkill_Blueprint.description>
