  <VVE_CarAlternator.label>载具发电机</VVE_CarAlternator.label>
  <!-- EN: The alternator - battery included - is an extremely vital engine part for any vehicle that has electrical systems. Some very basic systems can get away and some more complex vehicles can require more than one. -->
  <VVE_CarAlternator.description>非常重要的部件，载具需求它才能操控电子设备。一些简易载具可能用不上它，而复杂先进的载具则会大量需求。</VVE_CarAlternator.description>

  <!-- EN: car battery -->
  <VVE_CarBattery.label>载具电池</VVE_CarBattery.label>
  <!-- EN: An insulated rechargeable battery and wiring which powers numerous electronic functions. Acts as a surge protector for electronic systems and multiple batteries can augment or even replace a vehicle's engine. -->
  <VVE_CarBattery.description>包裹在绝缘外壳内的可充电电池，用于给载具的电子元件供电。它不仅可以用于给电子系统当缓冲，一些情况下还能作为载具的主动力来源。</VVE_CarBattery.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car exhaust -->
  <VVE_CarExhaust.label>载具排气管</VVE_CarExhaust.label>
  <!-- EN: A series of pipes, catalysts and fittings that transfer the exhaust from the car engine away from the driver’s cabin. Engines that will be put under a lot of strain require more exhausts. -->
  <VVE_CarExhaust.description>一组管道，催化剂和接口，用于将引擎产生的废气排出载具外。引擎出力越大的载具会需求越多的排气管。</VVE_CarExhaust.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car fuel tank -->
  <VVE_CarFuelTank.label>载具燃料罐</VVE_CarFuelTank.label>
  <!-- EN: Carefully manufactured fuel storage and injection systems. Ideal for vehicles that require greater fuel capacity or even increased fuel consumption without increasing the likelihood of gas leaks or engine damage. -->
  <VVE_CarFuelTank.description>精细制作的燃料储存以及存取系统。需求大量燃料的载具或是功率极大怕飞溅的燃料伤到其它元件的载具通常会需要这个专门的燃料罐。</VVE_CarFuelTank.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car radiator -->
  <VVE_CarRadiator.label>载具散热器</VVE_CarRadiator.label>
  <!-- EN: A series of pipes, tubes, fans, pumps, and the radiator itself, ready to be installed in a vehicle that is expected to endure heavy loads. The harder the engine will have to work, the more radiators required to keep it cool. -->
  <VVE_CarRadiator.description>一系列管道，风扇，水泵和辐射散热器，为了给大功率的载具散热使用。载具引擎的出力越大，需求的散热器就越多，</VVE_CarRadiator.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car suspension -->
  <VVE_CarSuspension.label>载具悬挂</VVE_CarSuspension.label>
  <!-- EN: A series of transmissions, springs and shock absorbers that redirect or reduce forces transferred through the wheels. Generally, the greater the mass and cargo capacity of the vehicle, the more suspensions are needed. -->
  <VVE_CarSuspension.description>一系列传动，弹簧和缓冲装置，用于平衡车轮受到的冲击力。重量和载货量越高的载具会需求越多的悬挂。</VVE_CarSuspension.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car transmission -->
  <VVE_CarTransmission.label>载具传动器</VVE_CarTransmission.label>
  <!-- EN: A dedicated, automatic transmission system delicately machined from hardened and durable materials. Due to its comparatively complex design, these are required in vehicles that require immense torque or excessive rotational speeds. -->
  <VVE_CarTransmission.description>用坚固材料精致打造的自动传动系统。高扭矩和高转速的载具引擎可能会需要加装传动器。</VVE_CarTransmission.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car wheel -->
  <VVE_CarWheel.label>载具车轮</VVE_CarWheel.label>
  <!-- EN: One of the most ancient technologies developed by man, the wheel takes the power from the engine and translates it into movement. As wheels have to not only move the vehicle in whichever direction necessary but also withstand the combined weight, larger and heavier vehicles can need several or dozens of them. -->
  <VVE_CarWheel.description>轮子可以说是最古老的技术之一了，而这种车轮专门用于将引擎产生的动力转化为载具的移动。车轮不仅能带动载具，还会用于分担载具的重量，因此重型载具可能会需求多对车轮。</VVE_CarWheel.description>
  
  <!-- EN: car wiring -->
  <VVE_CarWiring.label>载具电路</VVE_CarWiring.label>
  <!-- EN: Reinforced and machined wiring parts to improve electricity conduction. Typically required in vehicles that have a lot of synchronized or delicate electronic systems. -->
  <VVE_CarWiring.description>强化的电路元件，常被用于有复杂电子系统的载具。</VVE_CarWiring.description>
  
  <!-- EN: engine block -->
  <VVE_EngineBlock.label>载具引擎</VVE_EngineBlock.label>
  <!-- EN: Literally the part that gets a vehicle moving in the first place, no vehicle can be assembled without one. Exceedingly large or heavy vehicles could require more than one. -->
  <VVE_EngineBlock.description>载具动力的来源，也是必不可少的核心部件。重型载具可能会需求多套引擎。</VVE_EngineBlock.description>
