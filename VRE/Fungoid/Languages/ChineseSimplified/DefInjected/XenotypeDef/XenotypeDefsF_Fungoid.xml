  <!-- EN: A private military project gone awry, fungoids were initially developed as militarized mycelium to be deployed against the increasingly prevalent Insectoid threat. Subjects eventually succumb to degradation of higher reasoning skills but develop increasing resistance to injury and subsequent recovery. Can infect non-carriers through melee attacks, which is their main method of reproduction, if left untreated.\n\nDuring initial testing phases, the fungoid genome successfully infected numerous insectoid test subjects which were then released into controlled sites to determine their actual viability. In order to reduce their reliance on archite capsules, carriers were capable of transmitting infections through touch or airborne particles. However, foreign insectoids destroyed them as well as any of their own that showed signs of infection. Further still, due to the infectivity of the mycelium, any humans that were working on the project became infected.\n\nDue to concerns and misunderstandings on treatment, the operation site was glassed, but many of those present had managed to flee into orbit, only to become carriers themselves and infect others. -->
  <VRE_Fungoid.description>菌尸种是感染了基因改造真菌的、样貌扭曲骇人的可怕存在。这种真菌是某项军方机密计划的失败产物，它们原本是作为对抗威胁性与日俱增的索恩虫族的生物武器而培养制造的。根据遗存的实验记录可知，受感染者的学习能力与所掌握的技能知识会逐渐丧失，但同时也将获得随时间推移而增强的承伤与自愈能力。菌尸种可通过抓挠、撕咬等近战攻击方式感染他人，如果未能得到及时有效的治疗，则其异种基因很快就会被完全同化。\n\n为了进一步观察实战表现，研究员们在早期测试阶段于实验区内大量投放了这种真菌，并成功感染了数量可观的虫族受试对象。然而其他虫族很快便发现并侵入了研究设施，消灭了所有遭到感染的同类。由于在培养时只使用了少量超凡胶囊，这种真菌仅具有短距离空气与接触传播能力，可即便如此，它们仍然感染了设施里所有参与计划的人类。\n\n在恐惧与误解的煽动下，研究设施所在的区域最终被烧成了玻璃。虽然有不少幸存者想方设法撤离到了星球轨道上，但依旧逃不过变成菌尸种的命运。</VRE_Fungoid.description>
