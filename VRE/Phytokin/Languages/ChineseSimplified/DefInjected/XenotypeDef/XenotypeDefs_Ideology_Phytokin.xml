  <!-- EN: Based on genetic data retrofitted from Gauranlen Inc.’s investment into dendrology following the Fall of Sorne, phytokins are plant-based humanoids with an emphasis on symmetry and symbiosis. Their ability to subsist only on sunlight and affinity with any and all plantlife make them especially suited to aiding newly established colonies or underperforming industrial farms.\n\nBased on research from the forest planet of Phytok that committed to extensive analysis on human-compatibility with psychic energy, phytokin xenogerms are typically exclusive to high-ranking, supporting roles in megacorporations and planetary governments. Their unique way of reproduction has resulted in many identical offspring, with each generation becoming successively more competent than their progenitor, further contributing to their extremely low numbers. Their affinity with plantlife, along with the side effect of extremely high and ever-increasing psychic sensitivity, mean that any phytokin xenohumans found on the Rim are always adapted to high-concept, dominant trees that are present on their residing planet.\n\nThis particular xenogerm has adapted itself to Gauranlen trees, allowing them to act as a non-stationary Dryad Queen, albeit without potential for growth. They can also improve attempts at connecting with a local Gauranlen tree as well as being twice as effective as a non-phytokin at pruning their own tree. -->
  <VRE_Gauranlenkin.description>在索恩星（Sorne）陷落之后，我们成功复原了部分世界树公司在树木植物学方面的研究数据。其中揭示了树人种，这种拥有者共生能力的半植物人形异种。他们对阳光的利用能力以及对所有植物的亲和力使得他们成为了星际殖民和农业行业的最佳人选。\n\n树人种的胚芽最初来自在丛林星球菲托克（Phytok）上对于人类灵能亲和力的研究，这些胚芽现在常常只在星际巨企中的管理层职员上出现。树人种独特的繁育方式让他们的后代都极为相似，同时每一代都会比上一代更加优秀，这能有效补偿树人种稀少的种群人口。树人种对植物有着独特的亲和力，这也为他们的心灵敏感度带来了超乎常人的天赋以及成长性，这一特性让他们在边缘星球上常常与本地的高等树木产生共鸣。\n\n这一种胚芽专为母树设计，能让携带者成为一个刺激的树精女王。他们能强化与母树的联系，并有着常人双倍的修剪速度。</VRE_Gauranlenkin.description>
  <!-- EN: Powerful advisors to rulers and despots, gauranlenkins are beautiful and cunning and possess an ability to connect with a gauranlen tree, greatly enhancing its abilities. Gauranlenkins can spawn two dryads that will consider them their mother, and will obey their every command. They are excellent at taking care of plants and reproduce via planting a saplingchild. -->
