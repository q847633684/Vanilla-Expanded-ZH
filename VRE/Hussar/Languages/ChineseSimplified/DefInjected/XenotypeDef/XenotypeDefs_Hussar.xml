  <!-- EN: Uhlans are a side-development from captured hussars, turned by certain elements to become a counter to the military-developed supersoldier programs. Their genetic dependence on luciferium is both a deterrent against capturing and an improvement to long-term usefulness.\n\nAppropriately named demons for their permanently flushed skin and intense bloodthirst, uhlans are incredibly resilient and specialized in certain styles of combat. Quite often they are decked out in heavy armor, in which they can charge full tilt at their intended target.\n\nExtremely specialized and on a permanent hair-trigger, there has been much speculation that their development was sponsored by megacorporations as part of the latest arms race. No substantial evidence has been presented to support these claims. -->
  <VREH_Uhlan.description>枪骑种是骠骑种俘虏侧面发展的产物，因某些原因而成为了对抗军方而研发的生物兵器。他们对魔鬼素的依赖，既能威胁那些要俘虏他们的人，也能改进对魔鬼素的长期使用。\n\n枪骑种因其永久性的红色皮肤和强烈嗜血而获得了“恶魔”的外号，真是名副其实。枪骑种皮糙肉厚，擅长某种战斗风格。他们经常穿着厚重的装甲，向着预定好的目标全速冲锋。\n\n由于极度专业化和一触即发的战斗风格，很多人猜测他们的研发是由某家巨企赞助的，是最新军备竞赛的一部分。不过没有实质性的证据来佐证这些说法。</VREH_Uhlan.description>
  <!-- EN: Uhlans are engineered super-soldiers who fight aggressively and without emotion. They heal extremely fast, glide through obstacles using their small wings, freely ingest military drugs and rely on luciferium to keep their bodies functioning. -->
