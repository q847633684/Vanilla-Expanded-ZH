  <Sanguophage.label>赫血种</Sanguophage.label>
  <!-- EN: Sanguophages are a type of archotech-enhanced xenohuman. Powered by archites, their abilities go far beyond normal genetic enhancements. They are mentally adept and preternaturally beautiful. In combat, they can launch deadly spines and heal injured friends. They don't age or die naturally and never suffer from disease or poison. A sanguophage can make a new sanguophage by reimplanting their own xenogerm into a person.\n\nSanguophages must regularly consume hemogen derived from human blood, and they must periodically deathrest for long periods. They're easily destroyed by fire, and slowed down by UV light.\n\nThe first sanguophage appeared thousands of years ago when the lord-explorer Varan-Dur sought to control a hyperintelligent archotech and found himself transformed by it instead. Every sanguophage is descended from him. Since then, sanguophages have often been hunted because of their destabilizing power and their need for blood. Since they can pass for baseliners, many live in hiding among typical humans.\n\nTheir numbers are unknown. Some think they are legends or rare irrelevancies. Some believe sanguophages secretly direct entire human civilizations. The stories speak of eternal lords ruling billions from slate-black space stations, or directing blood sacrifices at conferences in the underlayers of the deepest urbworlds. -->
  <Sanguophage.description>血族是被超凡智能所强化过的异种人类，而赫血种则是其中最负盛名的一脉。在超凡微械的加持下，他们有着远超一般基因强化的超能力。他们精神强大，各个外形优美。在战斗中能发射致命的骨刺和治愈同伴。他们不会自然衰老和死亡，也不会受疾病和毒素侵扰。一个赫血种可以将自己的异种胚芽植入到另一个人身上来创造一个新的赫血种。\n\n赫血种必须定时摄入人类血液中的血原质和陷入为时不短的死眠。他们怕火，而且会被紫外线所弱化。\n\n千年以前，开拓公瓦兰·杜尔曾尝试控制一个超凡智能，但最终却被它改造成为了史上第一个赫血种，自此以后所有的血族便都由他而生。在那之后的血族由于其不稳定的超能力和对人血的依赖而常常被人类社会猎杀。由于他们的外形和普通人相似，所以常常隐藏在人类社会之中。\n\n当前血族的人数不为人知，有些人认为他们数量少到无关紧要，有些则猜测他们可能已经在暗中掌控了数个人类文明。宇宙之中不断有传说出现，诉说着在黑石太空站中号令亿万的永恒帝王，或是在都市世界底层中不断上演的血腥祭祀。</Sanguophage.description>

  <VRE_Bruxa.label>魅血种</VRE_Bruxa.label>
  <!-- EN: In the complex tapestry of the universe, the Bruxas emerged as a unique and alluring subxenotype of sanguophage. Created by an enigmatic archotech entity seeking to weave together beauty and power, the Bruxas were gifted with unparalleled grace and charm. Designed as the ultimate companions to other sanguophages, the Bruxas were engineered with the unique ability to bond with their brethren and feed on their blood, bestowing mutual benefits upon both parties.\n\nThe Bruxas are ageless and deathless, their bodies imbued with archotech-created archites that grant them extraordinary abilities. Possessing an ethereal beauty, they are irresistibly captivating to those who cross their paths. In addition to their regenerative powers, which allow them to heal any injury and remain immune to disease and poison, Bruxas have the remarkable ability to filter infections from the bloodstream of other humans, purifying their blood and filling them with an overwhelming sense of ecstasy in the process.\n\nThroughout the ages, the Bruxas have been both feared and revered for their beguiling beauty and potent abilities. Often serving as confidants and companions to powerful individuals, including sanguophage lords, they have been known to wield considerable influence in the shadow societies. Their unique ability to bond with other humans has led to the formation of secret alliances and networks, further solidifying their power and influence.\n\nIn the vast expanse of the universe, the Bruxas remain an enigma - seductive and mysterious, their true intentions hidden behind a veil of allure and grace. Those who encounter a Bruxa must tread carefully, for while their touch may bring unimaginable pleasure, it may also lead to a fate more treacherous than one could ever imagine. -->

  <!-- EN: In the darkest reaches of the universe, the Ekkimian vampires were birthed from the twisted ambitions of a rogue scientist named Dr. Mortis. Obsessed with the concept of death and resurrection, Dr. Mortis sought to create a new breed of immortals by fusing archites with the DNA of humans and a mysterious, long-extinct species that thrived on consuming the dead. The Ekkimian vampires, as they came to be known, are grotesque and horrifying in appearance. Resembling desiccated corpses more than living beings, their monstrous visages instill terror in all who lay eyes upon them. Despite their hideous appearance, the Ekkimian vampires possess incredible regenerative abilities, healing any injury and remaining immune to disease and poison.\n\nEkkimian vampires must consume hemogen derived exclusively from human corpses to survive. This morbid requirement has led them to lurk in the shadows, scavenging the remains of fallen warriors and feeding on the aftermath of battles. Like other sanguophages, they must periodically enter deathrest to recover their strength and replenish their hemogen reserves.\n\nThere are whispered tales of entire planets falling under the sway of Ekkimian vampire lords, who feed on the corpses of their enemies and rule with an iron, undead fist. Fearful of the day when these monstrous beings might rise up and unleash their full power, the inhabitants of the colonized planets must remain ever vigilant, lest they become mere fodder for the insatiable hunger of the Ekkimians. -->
