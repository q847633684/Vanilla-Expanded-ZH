  <!-- EN: A complete mystery whose earliest recorded appearance has been tied to the development of archotechnology and the first occurrences of Transcendence, the archons are an enigmatic race of quasi-humans capable of moving between dimensions. They have an optimized physiology for psycasting and are renowned for extreme levels of aggression even amongst themselves.\n\nDue to lack of communication between humans and archons, very little concrete information has been gleaned from what few interactions have been documented amongst the stars. However, there are numerous instances of archons kidnapping humans throughout the entirety of known space and any attempts at killing them are thwarted by the dimensional rifts from which they appear. No current technology exists that can observe, much less cross, different dimensions, and yet these archons appear without warning, following no pattern, and always exploiting any vulnerabilities. Their equipment appears to be of archotech origin, aligning with reports of planets with a significant human presence undergoing Transcendence, exhibiting a correspondingly elevated presence of archons. -->
  <VRE_Archon.description>超凡种是几乎全然成谜的神秘存在。他们拥有异常出色的灵能天赋与在维度间穿梭的奇特能力，且装备着可能源自超凡智能的强力武器护甲，但生性仇外好战，崇尚以武力解决问题。根据资料记载，超凡种的初次现身与人类开始深入研究超凡科技造物和首例“飞升”现象的发生有关。\n\n虽然超凡种很少和同族之外的人类进行交流，各个星球间也罕有同他们沟通过的具体记录，但有关他们四处掳掠的报告却在与日俱增。他们总是会毫无预兆地突然出现，从薄弱点侵入殖民地绑架人类。维度裂缝的干扰使任何试图杀死超凡种的行动均以失败告终，而无论是观测还是穿越其他维度，仅凭人类现有的科技水平根本无法做到。从现有情报来看，随着一颗人口众多的星球被超凡智能的“飞升”工程改造后，当地星系便会有疑似超凡种的身影出现。</VRE_Archon.description>
