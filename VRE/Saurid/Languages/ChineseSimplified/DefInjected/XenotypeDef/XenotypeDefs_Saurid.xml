  <!-- EN: Genetically spliced with synthesized reptile genetic material for improved compatibility with arid environments, saurids are cold-blooded isolationists with harsh voices and extremely low metabolisms. Their sharp claws and hardened scales make them particularly suited to melee encounters.\n\nFor workers looking for higher-wage jobs, saurid xenogerms are offered alongside employment packages to particularly arid and hot planets. As conditions are quite harsh, they experience an attitude shift to be less social and consume fewer calories which allows them to be more profitable. As they are not excluded from starting families, saurids can communicate with each other using pheromones and are oviparous to reduce medical complications caused by lack of proper social infrastructure. -->
  <VRESaurids_Saurid.description>爬蜥种是人类与爬行动物的遗传物质进行基因拼接，用以适应干旱环境性的产物。他们是冷血的孤立主义者、叫声刺耳、新陈代谢能力差。锋利的爪子和坚硬的鳞片使他们特别适合近战。\n\n在特别干旱和炎热的星球上寻找高新工作的人，就业时除了提供就业礼包，还会提供爬蜥种异种胚芽。由于环境恶劣，他们的处事态度发生了转变，变得不爱交际，减少新陈代谢对他们来说更有好处。他们不排斥建立家庭，可以利用信息素互相交流，并且因为是卵生生物，所以能够减少因缺乏基础医疗设施而引起的医疗并发症。</VRESaurids_Saurid.description>
  <!-- EN: Genetically engineered to survive on extremely low nutrition in the most arid environments, saurids adapt very well to hostile environments thanks to the oviparous nature of their reproduction as well as lizard-like genetic features. They prefer isolation and prefer to mate with other saurids. -->
  <VRESaurids_Saurid.descriptionShort>通过基因改造，可以在极其干旱的环境中以极低的营养消耗生存下去，由于其卵生的性质以及类似蜥蜴的基因，爬蜥种能够很好地适应恶劣环境。他们与世隔绝，更喜欢与其他爬蜥种交配繁衍。</VRESaurids_Saurid.descriptionShort>
