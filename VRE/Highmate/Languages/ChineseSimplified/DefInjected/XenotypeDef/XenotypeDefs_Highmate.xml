  <Highmate.label>优侣种</Highmate.label>
  <!-- EN: Designed companions and concubines with a unique ability to psychically bond with a mate, highmates are empathic, beautiful, cheerful, and talented in social matters. They are also inept at manual tasks, physically weak, and mentally incapable of violence.\n\nOn a few wealthy worlds, highmate xenogerms are commercially available and some people become highmates as a sort of career. However, many societies find them abhorrent, either because they distract people from forming natural families, or because they are humans shaped to serve the pleasures of another. On such worlds they are either reserved as playthings of the powerful, or banned entirely. This particular line of highmate fits the fashions of classical Novaroma, but many other variants exist. -->
  <Highmate.description>优侣种是被定制的伴侣或是爱人，能够与另一个人建立维系终生的心灵纽带。优侣种感情丰富，身体优美，在社交事务上有不错的天赋。他们的肉体虚弱，不擅长体力劳动，精神也不能忍受任何暴力。\n\n在某些富裕的星球上，优侣种的异种胚芽可以公开售卖，而成为优侣种本身被视作一种正常的工作。也有很多社会抵制这种改造，也许是因为优侣种的存在会让人不想组建传统的家庭，也许是认为这是对人的一种终极异化。在这些世界上，优侣种要么被留作权贵的玩物，要么被完全禁止。这一支优侣种发源于新星罗马，宇宙中也有其它不同的优侣种存在。</Highmate.description>

  <!-- EN: Derived from popular highmates with a greater focus on physical aspects of lovin’, lowmates are attractive companions for those looking for no-risk thrills without the risk of pregnancy. They also lack any violence inhibitors, both to defend themselves against people who won’t take “no” as an answer and for the client with more eclectic tastes.\n\nDeveloped for the lower classes of urbworlds, lowmate xenogerms are tied with employment contracts for those willing to sell their bodies regularly. Numerous controversies surround its development, as the workers become physically dependent on their work and are almost always on the hunt for their next “meal”, however it’s also recognized that taking any legislative action would remove any protections they are legally guaranteed with their contracts. Lowmates typically are on the lookout for regulars, but some are actively deployed as social weapons in politics. -->
  <VRE_Lowmate.description>荡偶种是衍自优侣种的一脉分支。与擅长建立心灵纽带的优侣种相反，荡偶种更专注于肉体上的欢愉。对那些想追求刺激却又不愿承担怀孕风险的人来说，他们无疑是绝妙的选择。由于剔除了限制暴力行为的基因，他们不仅能在面对施暴者时进行自保，也可以方便性癖复杂，“兼收并蓄”的客户开发一些“新玩法”。\n\n荡偶种的异种胚芽是专为那些生活在都市世界下层社会中的性工作者们研发的。当签订卖身契约后，他们便会被要求植入异种胚芽。荡偶种的基因使他们时刻处于欲求不满的状态，长此以往会产生严重的依赖性。虽然有关于此的争论与质疑从未停歇过，但这些人很清楚，如果真的通过法律途径抗议维权，那么契约所提供的福利和保障都将不复存在。多数荡偶种都会建起较为固定的老主顾圈子，但有些野心者则会积极发挥自身在社交方面的优势，力求能在政界中闯出一片天地。</VRE_Lowmate.description>
