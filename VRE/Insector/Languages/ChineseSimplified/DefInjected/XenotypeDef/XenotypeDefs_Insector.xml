  <!-- EN: Insectors were engineered as a military project to thrive on planets with harsh, insectoid environments. They can edit their genes to form various castes suited to different conditions, making them highly adaptable and self-sufficient. Living in symbiosis with insectoids, they reproduce by implanting a chestburster larva into a host.\n\nWith chitinous exoskeletons, multifaceted eyes, and segmented limbs, Insectors resemble a blend of humans and insects. Their isolationist nature and unsettling appearance often lead others to see them as cold and unapproachable. However, their society is complex and strategic, using fear and misunderstanding to their advantage in diplomacy and warfare, ensuring their survival in the harshest conditions. -->
  <VRE_Insector.description>异虫种是某项军方计划的基因改造产物，其目的是为了研究如何让人类也能在环境恶劣且虫族横行的星球上顺利扩张。他们可以按照自己的想法定制并形成能应对各种境况的基因种系，因而具有极强的自给与适应力。他们能与虫族和平共处，并通过将破胸胎儿植入到其他生物体内来繁衍生息。\n\n甲壳质外骨骼、复眼、节肢...异虫种有着许多奇特的生理结构，看起来就像是人类与虫族的杂交体一样。避世孤僻的天性和古怪的外貌让许多人觉得他们是难以沟通的高冷存在。虽然事实并非如此，但异虫种却欣然接受了众多误解与畏惧——毕竟这可以帮助他们在外交与战争中占据有利地位，即使面对最险恶的境况也有机会生存下去。</VRE_Insector.description>
