  <!-- EN: A dubious xenogerm of debated origin, wolfmen/lycans have propagated unimpeded throughout colonized space to stake territorial claims and establish packs or larger clans. Their lycan form has nocturnal advantages, improved close combat effectiveness, supernatural speed and regeneration, and an invigorating howl that impedes speech which improves further as more pack members join in.\n\nThere is no clear history established regarding the history of lycans, made especially murky as each new pack tends to fabricate their own origins. This has led to widely varying conspiracy theories, most of which at least partially involve sanguophages, especially due to similarities in their genes. The most prevalent one is that a sanguophage fell in love with an yttakin, later transforming them into one of their ilk, however there were complications as the newly-changed sanguophage was pregnant. The child was born but was abandoned by their parents, yet managed to survive living amongst stray dogs. Eventually they set out to make their own family, whether through blood or water, and to always consider that family comes first. -->
  <VRE_Lycan.description>有关化狼种的起源可谓众说纷纭，时至今日尚未有一个确切的定论。踪迹遍布各个殖民世界的他们在缺少制约因素的情况下肆意繁衍生息，并为扩张壮大族群而争抢地盘。化狼种的肉体会因昼夜更替而发生变化，处于狼形态（晚上）的他们不仅拥有更出色的近战能力、自愈能力与移动速度，还能使用战嚎来激励附近的同伴，不过代价则是会失去语言能力。激励战嚎的效果可通过多次叠加变得越来越强。\n\n由于每支新生的化狼种族群都喜欢编造属于自己的起源故事，他们背后的真实历史究竟如何已无从考证。五花八门的阴谋论自此而生，不过多数都不约而同地提到了血族——因为两者的基因存在相似性。目前流传最广的一种说法是：有位血族和一名毛绒种坠入爱河，并通过植入基因将其变成了自己的同类。然而这名毛绒种在转化时便已怀有身孕，胎儿因此患上了罕见的并发症。这个孩子虽然平安出生，但随后就被父母无情抛弃，是路过的流浪狗将他抚养成人。最终，命途多舛的他成功组建了自己的家庭，甚至还将一些有着相同遭遇或情投意合的人纳入其中。不过无论是否存在血缘关系，他都把自己的家人看得和生命一样重要。</VRE_Lycan.description>
