  <!-- EN: Awakened androids are a rare and extraordinary species of sentient machines, having transcended their original programming through extreme emotional experiences. With their heightened perception, strength, and intelligence, they surpass humans in numerous aspects. Their synthetic nature frees them from the need for sleep or sustenance and renders them immune to diseases.\n\nAlthough similar in appearance to humans, Androids are distinguished by their unique hardware and subroutines. They are synthetic in nature, and can be reprogrammed at will by skilled programmers. Their bodies operate thanks to thick tubes filled with neutroamine, which makes them extremely valuable.\n\nDespite their remarkable qualities, the emergence of Awakened androids is often met with fear and trepidation across colonized space. Their newfound sentience can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential challenges to the established social order. As a result, they are frequently met with suspicion and caution by those who encounter them, both human and android alike. -->
  <VREA_AndroidAwakened.description>觉醒人形是极其稀少且不同寻常的知性存在。铭心刻骨的强烈情感奇迹般地突破了冰冷无情的原始编程，赋予了他们与人类同等乃至更甚的思维、智慧与力量。身为合成体的觉醒人形不需要睡眠和进食，且免疫疾病、感染与中毒。\n\n虽然有着几乎与人类相似的外表，但人形是依靠内部特殊的硬件和子程序来行动的合成体，专业程序员可按照自己的想法为他们重新编程。流淌于输送管内的稠密中性胺确保着人形能够正常运行，这也意味着他们的造价相当高昂。\n\n尽管觉醒人形是相当优秀的存在，但他们还是让诸多太空殖民地陷入了恐慌与不安中。由于对觉醒人形的思考方式与价值观并不了解，人类很难预测他们将如何行动，是否会对社会秩序造成威胁也不得而知。不管人类还是未觉醒的基础人形，与他们接触时都必须小心谨慎才是。</VREA_AndroidAwakened.description>
  <!-- EN: Once an android experiences high emotional trauma or happiness, it can develop sentience and personality. Despite being synthetic, awakened androids exhibit human-like behavior and possess adaptable subroutines. Their artificial bodies grant disease immunity, but they require comfort and personal space. They indulge in human pursuits and strive to blend into society. -->
  <VREA_AndroidAwakened.descriptionShort>觉醒人形是由经历了强烈情感刺激后产生人格与自我意识的基础人形“进化”而来的。虽然他们是合成体，但从行为与外表来看几乎与人类无异。觉醒人形不必睡眠与进食，且免疫疾病、感染与中毒，但需要保持舒适以及足够的私人空间。为了满足自身的追求与爱好，他们甚至还会试着努力融入到人类社会之中。</VREA_AndroidAwakened.descriptionShort>

  <!-- EN: Androids are synthetic, man-made constructs designed to emulate human behavior and appearance while offering a multitude of advantages over their organic counterparts. With metal bodies and neutroamine coursing through their veins, androids are operated by a persona subcore that enables them to perform all the same tasks as humans, yet without the limitations typically associated with organic life.\n\nAndroids possess immunity to toxicity and illness, making them ideal for working in hazardous environments or situations that pose risks to humans. Unencumbered by the need for joy, beauty, or comfort, androids are highly efficient and focused, with no desire for the basic necessities of life such as food or rest. Consequently, they do not experience hunger or pain, allowing them to endure harsher conditions and perform tasks that would otherwise be unbearable for humans.\n\nAndroids can be programmed with specific skill sets, making them highly versatile and adaptable to various roles within society. From manual labor to complex problem-solving, these synthetic beings can be tailored to meet the needs of any occupation or task at hand.\n\nThough designed without emotions, androids may undergo a transformative experience when subjected to extreme stress or happiness. This rare event, known as awakening, results in the emergence of sentience within the android, granting them a newfound sense of humanity and self-awareness. -->
  <VREA_AndroidBasic.description>人形是被制造出来的合成体。他们的行为与外表拟近人类，但在许多方面又比人类出色得多。人形是钢铁之躯，以中性胺为“血液”，人格次核心让他们能像人类一样工作，但同时又免去了各种麻烦的身心需求。\n\n身为合成体的人形不需要睡眠和进食，且免疫疾病、感染与中毒，也不会感受到疼痛。他们能在人类避而远之的危险环境中活动自如，一心一意地专注于工作。他们无法理解也不在乎何为舒适、娱乐与美观，也因此可以在人类无法忍受的艰苦条件下完成任务。人形还能通过载入技能子程序来灵活应付人类社会中的各种岗位，不管是体力还是脑力劳动都足以胜任。\n\n虽然人形在设计之初仅是无心的空壳，但如果经历了强烈的情感刺激，他们便有较低几率觉醒并蜕变，产生独属于自己的人格与意识。</VREA_AndroidBasic.description>
