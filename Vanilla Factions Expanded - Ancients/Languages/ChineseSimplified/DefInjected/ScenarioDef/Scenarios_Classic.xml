  <!-- EN: With each passing day you stare at your fellow companions hibernating in cryptosleep sarcophagi. One day, when your life is nearing its end, you will wake your successor, and his watch will begin. Every day for the last hundreds of years your outpost was awaiting orders from High Command which may no longer exist. Will today be the day you not only wake up, but also open your eyes?\n	\nNote: Since you start alone with random superpowers and weaknesses, this is a difficult scenario. -->
  <RE_NewVault.description>日复一日，你一直在守望着休眠舱中的同伴们。某天，当你寿命将尽时，你会唤醒自己的继任者，而他将继续履行你的职责。在过去的几百年里，你们的哨站基地每天都在等待着最高指挥部发来的命令，即使它们可能早就不复存在了。那么，今天的你，会真正地“醒来”吗？\n	\n注意：你的初始角色会拥有随机的超能力与弱点，这是个高难度的剧本。</RE_NewVault.description>

  <!-- EN: It was a fortuitous find: The tribe's foragers were looking for some berries, and stumbled upon the mysterious hole in the ground. Was it man-made, or built by the gods themselves? We soon discovered that it was obviously the latter, as offerings made to the wondrous structure were magically catapulted to the heavens, and returned as something else entirely as a reward for our devotion.\n\nNote: You'll start poor and lack technology, but having the supply slingshot means it will be easier than a standard tribal start. -->
  <VFEA_CargoCult.description>我们偶然发现了新的收获：部落里的伙伴在外出采集莓果时，无意间看到地上有个神秘的大洞。这究竟是其他部落的所作所为，还是神明留下的伟大印记？我们很快便发现答案是后者，因为向洞中投入的祭品全都被神力吸入到了天国中，对此感到满意的神明也向我们投下了许多赏赐。\n\n注意：你的开局会很穷并且研究很慢，但远古补给弹射器的存在会使发展变得容易一些。</VFEA_CargoCult.description>
