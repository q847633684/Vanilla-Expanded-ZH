  <!-- EN: For those who want a transport pod that doesn’t crash into the ground as a method of braking, this hunk of metal fitted with far too many thrusters will not only get you into situations but also back out of them. It is ridiculously wasteful in terms of fuel but it works incredibly well as an ambush vehicle, moving five times faster than drop pods. Earned its nickname as it can only move by launching itself into the stratosphere, thanks to oversized boosters. -->
  <VVE_Frog_Blueprint.description>T1载具。它与寻常的运输舱类似，但在着陆时不会把自己砸个稀烂。它的外壳上安装了大量反推引擎，可以在着陆后再次自行起飞。它的耗油量高到惊人，但它的移速是运输舱的5倍，是偷袭绝佳之选。它在发射时能用力大砖飞的推进器一口气把自己喷上平流层，因而得名。\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;乘员：&lt;/color&gt;操作员 x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;动力：&lt;/color&gt;化合燃料</VVE_Frog_Blueprint.description>
