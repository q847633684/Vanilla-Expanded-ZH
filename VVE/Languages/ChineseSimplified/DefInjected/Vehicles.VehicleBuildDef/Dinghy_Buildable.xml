  <!-- EN: A very basic motorised boat, the Dingy is an incredibly cheap and discrete method of transportation over water. Has a good cargo capacity, however it is likely to get frozen solid in the winter times and moves slowly on rivers. The exposed rear-mounted engine is vulnerable to attacks and the hull plating should not be expected to wither projectile weapons.\n\nSimilar to other tier 1 vehicles, this is a gas guzzler and best used for medium distances. -->
  <VVE_Dinghy_Blueprint.description>T1载具。非常简单的动力小艇，让你能在水面快速移动。有着不错的载货量，但在冬季可能会在河面上寸步难行。尾部的外置引擎非常容易在战斗中受损，它的船体也没有防弹能力。\n\n它和大多数T1载具一样是个油老虎。\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;乘员：&lt;/color&gt;驾驶员 x1，乘客 x5\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;动力：&lt;/color&gt;化合燃料</VVE_Dinghy_Blueprint.description>
