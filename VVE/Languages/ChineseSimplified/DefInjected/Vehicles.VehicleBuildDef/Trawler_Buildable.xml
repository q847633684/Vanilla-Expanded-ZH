  <!-- EN: A general-purpose boat, the Trawler is an effective long distance transportation across open waters. Performs rather poorly on rivers and has to travel slowly during the winter season.\n\nSimilar to other tier 2 vehicles, this has double fuel efficiency on the world map which makes them more efficient than tier 1 vehicles. They are also less visible due to improved manufacturing. -->
  <VVE_Trawler_Blueprint.description>T2载具。一艘多功能水面载具。巡游艇可以在开放水域上长途旅行，但在内河以及寒冷环境下略显无力。\n\n它和其它T2载具一样，在世界地图上有着T1载具双倍的燃料效能。而且改进后的工艺让它更加难被发现。\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;乘员：&lt;/color&gt;驾驶员 x1，乘客 x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;动力：&lt;/color&gt;化合燃料</VVE_Trawler_Blueprint.description>
