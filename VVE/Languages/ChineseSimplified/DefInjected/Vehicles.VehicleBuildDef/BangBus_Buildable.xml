  <!-- EN: A possible health warning for when too many people get together and travel long distances in a tight space, the Bangbus is a rickety pile of scrap that can hold an entire squad of raiders. Earning its name from the incredibly loud backfire when the engine stalls, this is not something you want to take anywhere away from roads and especially not in the winter time. While it can’t hold much in the way of cargo, it is a terrific passenger transport with a high mileage considering it’s largely made from corrugated steel. -->
  <VVE_BangBus_Blueprint.description>T1载具。如果你不介意和一堆人挤在一起度过漫长的旅行时光的话，这堆破铜烂铁勉强能算是个合格的运兵车。引擎点火时会发出非常扰民的噪音，因而得名。它在冬季和野外几乎挪不开步子。虽然没有多少货运空间，但它的乘员容量却不少，也是个性价比不错的载具。\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;乘员：&lt;/color&gt;驾驶员 x1，乘客 x5\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;动力：&lt;/color&gt;化合燃料</VVE_BangBus_Blueprint.description>
