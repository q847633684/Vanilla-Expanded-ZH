  <!-- EN: While they’re surprisingly tireless when they have a home to rest at, these manned mares are quite reluctant to hurry along when made to carry loads in a caravan. Their body’s efficiency means they’ll get a task done when it needs to, and not a moment sooner. What makes it worse is that they’re smart enough to know that they’re cute - and powerful - enough to get away with it.\n\nAn equine hybrid with recessive ursine genes. The inherent hibernating nature of bears has combined with the high energy of horses to create this particular hybrid that requires little in the way of rest and a much more efficient and versatile digestive system. They are quite a bit slower as a consequence, along with their higher body mass.\n\n<color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:</color> All equine hybrids are good for caravaning. A caravan with one of them needs a shorter resting period, only stopping to rest between 23:30 PM and 4 AM. -->

  <!-- EN: Inherently less effective at refining chemfuel when allowed to rest at its leisure while also being a good pack animal and riding companion. During distant travels, the long periods of engagement for their muscles actively puts their glands into overdrive. Quite effective should there be a vehicle that uses chemfuel, but don’t ask how that would work out. Maybe it’s the desire to compete against machinery or knowing that if the vehicle breaks down it's gonna have to do all that bloody walking again.\n\nAn equine hybrid with recessive boomalope genes. While they are comparatively slower, their inherent need to exercise means that their capability in producing chemfuel is severely hampered if their muscles aren’t engaged for long periods of time.

Don’t worry though, it only wants to pin you down and drown you in fur and saliva.\n\nAn equine hybrid with recessive feline genes. Quite durable and combat capable for a pack animal, they can be drafted to execute at-will pouncing to close distance with the enemy. They are only slightly less effective as horses in riding but have better stamina, in exchange they are pure carnivores so their diet can be rather restrictive.\n\n<color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:</color> All equine hybrids are good for caravaning. A caravan with one of them needs a shorter resting period, only stopping to rest between 23:30 PM and 4 AM.

A delightfully speedy mount that can pull off some impressive turns, this hybrid has been bred even further with other species to make for more colourful and genetically stable bird mounts. Some speculate that this particular creature is the original ancestor of the Ave, while the Royal Ave came from those that were bred more for plumage than performance.\n\nAn equine hybrid with recessive avian genes. Comparatively smaller than a purebred, but incredibly fast both in a singular location and as part of a caravan. A rather unusual hybrid in that it reproduces very slowly in a safe, similar environment, however this changes on caravan trips. Constant new sights and experiences puts their reproductive cycle into overdrive as it tries to spread its species over a broad horizon, however these eggs are genetically sterile so that they instead provide a healthy protein supplement for those who can only gather fruits and vegetables.\n\n<color=#E5E54C>Gameplay effect:</color> All equine hybrids are good for caravaning.

  <!-- EN: A rather muscular hybrid with an impressively long snout, this ravenous reptile combines adaptability with mobility. Unusually, its terrifyingly long maw filled with curved teeth is not used to tear flesh to eat but to imbue toxins and the required muscles to spray those toxins out. This means they have to eat a lot more due to their subpar digestive system and their favourite activities include lounging in the sun and moving with disturbing quickness when the dinner bell is sounded. Also it… kinda looks like a weird shoe if you look at it, but, uh, don’t put your foot in there.\n\nAn equine hybrid with recessive reptile genes.
