  <RB_Bee_Organic_Drone.description>Organic bees are genetically modified bees that extract cellulose fibers from nearby plants and convert it into a slurry of genetic material which can be refined into template genomes. The main use of these bees, however, is to hybridize them with other bees to create genetic bees of different subspecies.\n\nBee Traits:\n\nProduction time: 5 days hours\nNocturnal: No\nPluviophile: No\nUnusual plants needed: No\nMinimum Temperature: 0ºC\nMaximum temperature: 30ºC</RB_Bee_Organic_Drone.description>
