  <!-- Bear -->

  <GR_BeeHybrid_Bearbee.label>bearbee</GR_BeeHybrid_Bearbee.label>
  <GR_BeeHybrid_Bearbee.description>A Bear / Bee hybrid. This huge bee hybrid is fiercely agressive and territorial. It will act as a very powerful attack animal with venomous attacks if properly trained.\n\nUseful abilities: All bee hybrids slowly produce their appropriate honeycombs every few days. They also have a very nasty venomous sting. Finally, they will ignore terrain movement costs, since they hover over the ground, except over water, where their movement is slightly impeded.</GR_BeeHybrid_Bearbee.description>

  <!-- Boomalope -->

  <GR_BeeHybrid_Boombee.label>boombee</GR_BeeHybrid_Boombee.label>
  <GR_BeeHybrid_Boombee.description>A Boomalope / Bee hybrid. This bee hybrid is covered in chemfuel pustules and it is highly unstable.\n\nUseful abilities: All bee hybrids slowly produce their appropriate honeycombs every few days.

It will also explode in a cloud of bees when it dies, which is incredibly stupid from a scientific standpoint, but it is cool, so meh. Finally, they will ignore terrain movement costs, since they hover over the ground, except over water, where their movement is slightly impeded.</GR_BeeHybrid_Boombee.description>
