  <RB_GeneticHoney.description>This honey has been extracted from any genetic honeycomb, and has a very strange greenish tone that makes it less appetizing. Decays incredibly fast, but it can be consumed as a potent physically enhancing drug that doesn't cause any side effects. This honey can be consumed raw or cooked with other ingredients, and its properties transfer to the resulting meal.</RB_GeneticHoney.description>
