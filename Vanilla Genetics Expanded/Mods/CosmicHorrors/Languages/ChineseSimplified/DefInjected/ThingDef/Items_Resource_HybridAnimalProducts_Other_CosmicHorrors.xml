  <GR_EldritchInsectJelly.description>Jelly stored and used as food by oversized insects. It is smooth, rich, and brings incredible joy to those who consume it. Also, it quickly erodes their sanity and turns them into insane psychopaths, but it's so tasty! Because of its unique biological properties, it can nourish almost any creature and never rots.</GR_EldritchInsectJelly.description>
