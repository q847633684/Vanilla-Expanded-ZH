They probably would use it to build complex structures similar to bees, but they don't because... well, because they are a scientific abomination doomed from the start... Because of its unique biological properties, it can nourish almost any creature and never rots.</GR_DinoInsectJelly.description>

  <GR_ScalyBearPelt.description>This enormous bear pelt is part hair and part scales. It is probably valuable as a trade good. Or it can also be repurposed as a huge rug.</GR_ScalyBearPelt.description>
