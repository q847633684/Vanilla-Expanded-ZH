  <GR_DinoGenomeExcavator.description>A simplified genome extraction device designed to be usable by even the most simple-minded goon, as such it resembles a caulking gun that works in reverse. The best genetic material can be found in the brain and the automated, single-use design instantly compresses this material into a usable genome.\n\nThe desired subject needs to be docile and trusting of the user who intends on scooping out their brain in a process that is not-quite instantaneous.
