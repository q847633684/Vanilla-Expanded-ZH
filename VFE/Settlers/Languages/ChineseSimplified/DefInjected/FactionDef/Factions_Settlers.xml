  <!-- EN: These people have lived here for decades or centuries, and have lost most of the technology that brought them to this world. They are a loose confederation of bandit gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nBandits don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors. -->
  <SettlerSavage.description>这些人可能已经在这里生活了数十年甚至上百年，之前所掌握的大部分科技成果基本都已经失传了。他们使用高级的火药武器自卫，组成一个松散的匪帮联盟，唯一的共识就是一致对外。\n\n匪帮不播种，不建设，也很少会做贸易。在重视个人力量和残酷无情的铁血荣誉文化的驱使下，他们基本靠掠夺与抢劫区域内的其他活跃组织使自己变为富有。</SettlerSavage.description>
