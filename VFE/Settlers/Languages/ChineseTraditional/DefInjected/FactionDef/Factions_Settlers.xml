  <!-- EN: These people have lived here for decades or centuries, and have lost most of the technology that brought them to this world. They are a loose confederation of bandit gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nBandits don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors. -->
  <SettlerSavage.description>這些人可能已經在這裡生活了數十年甚至上百年，之前所掌握的大部分科技成果基本都已經失傳了。他們使用高級的火藥武器自衛，組成一個鬆散的匪幫聯盟，唯一的共識就是一致對外。\n\n匪幫不播種，不建設，也很少會做貿易。在重視個人力量和殘酷無情的鐵血榮譽文化的驅使下，他們基本靠掠奪與搶劫區域內的其他活躍組織使自己變為富有。</SettlerSavage.description>
