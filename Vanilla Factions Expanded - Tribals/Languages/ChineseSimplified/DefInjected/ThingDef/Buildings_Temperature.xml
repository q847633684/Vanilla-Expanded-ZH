  <!-- EN: Produces large amounts of heat and smoke, and burns out after a quadrum. The light from a large fire is visible from afar. As long as it’s burning outdoors, there is a higher chance of wild men wandering in, as well as raids. As with all heat sources, it must be placed indoors so it has a closed space to heat. Refuelable. Due to the size and instability of it, it may eject sparks around itself that may start a fire. -->
  <VFET_LargeFire.description>层层堆叠成的大篝火。点燃后会产生比普通篝火更多的热量和烟雾，并缓慢地燃烧一个象。它冲天的火光格外引人注目，这会提高袭击与野人加入事件的几率。和其他热源一样，必须放置在室内封闭空间才能取暖。可以补充燃料。\n\n大篝火燃烧时迸出的火花有引起火灾的风险，请务必提前做好防火措施。</VFET_LargeFire.description>
