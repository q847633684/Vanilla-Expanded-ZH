  <!-- EN: The toxlion is a sad reflection of what once was a proud and powerful predator. Its toxic environment has left it weak and emaciated, forcing it to survive by feeding on waste. Despite its diminished state, the Toxlion is still a threat. Its bites and claws have a high chance of spreading the toxflu, and it hunts in large packs to make up for its lack of strength and speed.\n\nToxflu is a highly contagious and rapidly striking disease, characterized by fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. It spreads quickly through contact with infected bodily fluids. Those who contract Toxflu can experience severe respiratory distress and, in severe cases, death. It goes away nearly as quickly as it appears, however anyone who interacted socially with a person suffering from toxflu has a chance of catching it. -->
  <VAEWaste_Toxlion.description>已对污染和毒素产生抗性的突变生物。污毒狮有着与“草原之王”这一称号完全不符的姿态。这些常年在环境恶劣的废土中徘徊的捕食者看起来是如此瘦削憔悴、萎靡不振，但也绝非弱不禁风的“病猫”。为了补足力量与速度上的劣势，污毒狮会采用群体协作的方式来作战捕猎，且它们的撕咬有极高几率会使生物患上污毒流感。\n\n污毒流感发作速度快、传染性极强，患者通常会产生发烧、咳嗽、无力、呼吸困难等症状。这种疾病也能通过体液传播，为了防止交叉感染，请尽量避免让患者与其他人进行社交互动。污毒流感会随着时间流逝慢慢康复，但有可能对肺部造成永久性的损伤。\n\n污毒狮的肉有毒，请三思而后食。</VAEWaste_Toxlion.description>
